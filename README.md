# AlphaJournal - MVP (Dark Neon)

Deploy steps:
1. Upload these files to your GitHub repository root (AlphaJournal).
2. Ensure assets/js/firebase-config.js contains your Firebase config (it was pre-filled).
3. Enable GitHub Pages on branch main → / (root).

This project is offline-first and will sync to Firebase when the user is authenticated.
